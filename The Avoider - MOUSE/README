THE AVOIDER - Mouse version

-You are a red rectangle with 3 lives
-You have to avoid balls that are bouncing across the screen (you use mouse, not keyboard)
-You have to move or you'll die
-All ball values are random (spawning x, spawning y, moving angle, speed, color)
-Spawning ratio of balls is greater than in keyboard version 


HAVE FUN! :)
